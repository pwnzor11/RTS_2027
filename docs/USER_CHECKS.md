## Standing smoke test
1. `git -C <repo> log -2 --oneline` shows the `Last commit:` hash from docs/HANDOFF.md as the newest or second-newest commit (the handoff commit may sit on top).
2. (Once there is a build) build from clean clone, run, main menu appears.

- Open `docs/research/README.md` on GitHub → 20 rows (00_SYNTHESIS plus 01–06, 10–17, 20–24) and
  every linked file exists and renders.
- Open `docs/DECISIONS.md` → entries run D-001 through D-034; D-033 says "assumed — confirm".
- Open `docs/design/` → three files: `01_architecture.md`, `02_game_design.md`,
  `03_setting_and_factions.md`.
- Open `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` → only Q-24 and Q-25 are open; rounds 1–3 are under Answered.
- Open `docs/LICENSING.md` → the EA additional terms are summarised (no trademarks, keep notice, mark
  modifications) and the derived-files register is empty.
- Search the repo for "Tiberium", "GDI", "Nod", "Westwood" → hits only inside `docs/research/`,
  `docs/LICENSING.md`, `docs/00_START_HERE.md` and this file, always as references to the EA games,
  never as names of our own things.
- Open `docs/DECISIONS.md` → runs D-001 through D-035 (supersedes the D-034 line above).
